class AutoRecursive:
    """
    This is a wrapper for autorecursive prediction.
    It can be used for simulation-like, time series prediction

    It takes a trained model (M) and, given an intial set of features (y0), predicts 
    a variable number of steps into the future (y1 ... yn).

    Generally, the intial set of features matches the model output, just offset by one time step.
    i.e. M(yn) = yn+1.

    It is also possible to have a model that uses sets of features from different time steps as 
    input.
    i.e. M(yn-k, ... yn) = yn+1
    in this case the wrapper always replaces the most recent value along the time axis with 
    the prediction
    e.g. M(yn) 
    

    INPUTS:
    y0s: inital set of features, of shape (lookback + 1, state_variables)
    num_predictions, Integer, number of steps to predict
    inputs: optional set of input features that are not used recursively,
       in the shape of (n, lookback + 1, input features) or (n, 1, input features)

       must be at least as long as the number of predictions,
       if the time axis is 1 then in the set of y0s the lookback + 1 is flattened into a single input vector
       (1, [lookback + 1] * state_variables) so that the inputs can be of the same shape.

       otherwise the time axis must be of lookback + 1.
